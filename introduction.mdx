# About GTA V Transcripts

**GTA V Transcripts** is a fan-made project dedicated to documenting every line of dialogue from every mission in *Grand Theft Auto V*.

Whether you're a writer, a modder, a voice acting enthusiast, or just a curious fan, this site provides accurate, readable transcripts to help you explore the story of GTA V in full detail, from the opening heist to the final showdown.

### ðŸŽ¯ Why this exists

GTA V is full of unforgettable moments, witty banter, and deep character interactions â€” but most of that dialogue is locked behind gameplay. This site makes the entire script accessible in one place, mission by mission.

### ðŸ’¡ Features

- Transcripts for every main story mission  
- Character-attributed dialogue in a clean, readable format  
- Searchable, collapsible layout (coming soon!)  
- 100% spoiler-filled â€” you've been warned!

### ðŸ™Œ A Note from the Creator

Hi, Iâ€™m Isaac â€” this project started as a personal way to dig deeper into the world of GTA V. If you find it useful or just fun to read through, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
